# SAMPLE CONFIG - TUNE ACCORDINGLY

# e.g. for nodes named node1 node2 node3... prefix is "node"
hostprefix=node

# define CIDR for storage cluster network, NOT the guest network
network=10.3.3.0/24

# define network parms for the guest network
# e.g. when running kvm/libvirt
ip=192.168.122.1$minor/24
gw=192.168.122.1
dns1=192.168.122.1
# TODO switch to /16 and expand MINOR

# pubkeys you want all the guests to have by default.  keep empty if not required
